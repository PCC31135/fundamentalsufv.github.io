# Practical work 2, Pablo Cerdeira Crespo

The purpose of this project is to recommend songs and music through a blog based on my tastes.

Key elements:
  1. Home page - In the home page , musical recommendations are made, separating the types of music by gender. Also there's an index where you can navegate to the contact part , about me , etc...
  2. About Me - In this page I give a description about who am , what I study and my motivations on doing this work
  3. Contact Me - A little page where you can contact me by email , including my phone number.
  4. 
Conclusion:
  I onestly enjoy making this work even I didn't know anything about html and css , but this work has made me realize that you don't need software like canva or other web apps that proporcionate software
  to automate the process of creating.
