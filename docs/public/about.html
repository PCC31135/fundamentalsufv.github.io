          I am a student at the Francisco de Vitoria University who is studying a degree in Computer Engineering. I am 18 years old and I live in Madrid.
          I have always had a great passion for music, which has led me to create this personal blog in which I can share with you my musical tastes and what I consider the best songs of some of the genres that I enjoy listening to the most.
          Apart from listening to this music, I am a great fan of instruments like the guitar or the piano. I hope you enjoy these recommendations as much as I do.
